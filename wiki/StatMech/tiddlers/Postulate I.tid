title: Postulate I
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

> There exists particular states, called equilibrium states, of systems which are macroscopically characterised completely by the intensive parameters, that is, the internal energy $$U$$, volume $$V$$, number of particles $$N$$ and so on.

This postulate tells us how equilibrium states can be identified for a system. Once we have established the existence of the //measurable// states, we are in a position to use our measurements and apply the theory.
