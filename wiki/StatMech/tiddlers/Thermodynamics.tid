title: Thermodynamics
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

Thermodynamics is mainly concerned with the transformation of heat into mechanical work and the opposite transformations of mechanical work into heat. It is a phenomenological subject, which means that the study is done based only on our experiences and observations of the macro world. It does not bother much about the microscopic details of any system but talks about the externally observable quantities based only on externally measurable quantities.
